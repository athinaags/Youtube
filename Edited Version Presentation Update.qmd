# Introduction

## Research question

**What factors most strongly influence engagement on YouTube?**

---

### Examples of factors

-   Number of views
-   How long people watch
-   Day of the week posted
-   Number of likes and comments

#### Why this matters

Understanding what drives engagement helps us:

-   Make better content
-   Post at the right time
-   Grow our audience faster

---

# Data Overview

## What data did we analyze?

-   Time period: September 2019 - November 2024 (5 years)
-   Number of videos: About 300 videos
-   Daily records: 234,889 observations
-   Source: YouTube Analytics (official data)

## What we measured

We looked at:

-   Views: How many people watched
-   Likes: Approval
-   Comments: Active engagement
-   Watch time: How long people watched
-   Subscribers gained: New followers

---

# What is Engagement?

## Simple definition

**Engagement** = How much people interact with your videos

$$\text{Engagement Rate} = \frac{\text{Likes + Comments}}{\text{Views}} \times 100$$

## How do we measure if the engagement rate is good or bad?

-  There is no universal standard for engagement across all youtube channels, so we used our own data

---

# Our Findings

## First steps

**Status of our data set**: Messy, has gaps, duplicates, mixed-up data types

**Example of what "messy" looks like:**

```         
date          | views | likes | comments | watch_time | notes
2019-09-01    | 1500  | 45    | (blank)  | 12500      | (incomplete)
2019-09-01    | 1500  | 45    | (blank)  | 12500      | (duplicate row!)
2019-09-02    | NULL  | 50    | 3        | (text!)    | (broken data)
```

**What we did:** Clean up this mess into usable files

---

## Cleaning the Data

Here's what we fixed:

-   **Fixed data types**: Converted text numbers to real numbers
    -   So we can do math on them
-   **Converted dates**: Turned text dates into proper date format
    -   Extracted year, month, day of week for analysis
-   **Removed incomplete rows**: Deleted rows with zero views
    -   Can't calculate engagement rates without views
-   **Fixed missing values**: Replaced blanks with 0

Result: Ended up with 4 clean data sets

---

## Created Engagement Metrics

We created new columns to measure engagement:

-   **Engagement Rate** = (Likes + Comments) ÷ Views × 100

    -   Example: 50 likes + 5 comments ÷ 1000 views = **5.5%**

-   **Like Rate** = Likes ÷ Views × 100

-   **Comment Rate** = Comments ÷ Views × 100

-   **Engagement Score** = (Comments × 2 + likes + shares × 3) / views × 100

**Why?** With raw numbers it's difficult to compare videos. With rates it isn't.

---

### Example:

### The raw CSV has:

-   **views** = 1000
-   **likes** = 50
-   **comments** = 5

### But you can't directly answer questions like:

-  "Is 50 likes good or bad for 1000 views?"

---

## Removed Duplicates & Aggregated

-   **Removed duplicate rows**: Deleted identical records that appeared twice

-   **Aggregated by video**: Collapsed 234,889 daily records into **\~300 videos**

    -   **Before:** Each row is one day for one video. So if a video has been up for 100 days, it had 100 rows.
    -   **Now:** 1 row per video with:
    -   Calculated totals: total views, total likes, total comments
    -   Calculated averages: average engagement per video
    -   Found: first publish date, last recorded date, days active

---

# Average Rates

## Average & Median Engagement Rate

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
video_perf <- read_csv("data/video_performance.csv")

# Table 1: Engagement Rates
engagement_stats <- video_perf %>%
  summarise(
    "Avg Engagement" = paste0(round(mean(engagement_rate, na.rm = TRUE), 2), "%"),
    "Median Engagement" = paste0(round(median(engagement_rate, na.rm = TRUE), 2), "%")
  )

knitr::kable(engagement_stats)
```


-  **We look at them to see what is 'good' or 'bad'**
---

## Like and Comment Rates

```{r}
# Table 2: Like and Comment Rates
like_comment_stats <- video_perf %>%
  summarise(
    "Like Rate" = paste0(round(mean(like_rate, na.rm = TRUE), 2), "%"),
    "Comment Rate" = paste0(round(mean(comment_rate, na.rm = TRUE), 2), "%")
  )

knitr::kable(like_comment_stats)
```

---

## Key statistics

-   Average engagement: 3.32% (meaning on average, 3.32 out of 100 viewers like or comment)
-   Median engagement: 1.89% (middle value - many videos have lower engagement)
-   Likes are more common: About 1.76% average like rate
-   Comments are rare: Only 0.09% average comment rate (comments are 15-20x less common than likes!)

### What this means

Anything above **3.32%** is above our channel baseline (good); anything below is below average.

Keep in mind this benchmark is specific to our data. Factors we did not account for include:

-   Channel size
-   Content type
-   Audience loyalty
-   Upload frequency

# Review

## Difficulties

-   Data cleaning took longer than expected
    -   Messy & complicated at first
    -   Packages didn't load correctly (many errors)

-   Only defined engagement rate and not all additional metrics early on

-   Sharing the R project and reproducibility steps remain

---

## What Comes Next

Now we dig deeper to find what **actually drives** engagement:

-   **Correlation Analysis**
    -    Which metrics are connected?
    -   Do longer videos get more likes?
    -   Do videos posted on weekends get more engagement?
    -   Does watch time predict comments?

-   **Visualizations & Graphs**
    -   Show trends visually
    -   Line charts: Engagement over time
    -   Bar charts: Performance by day of week
    -   Scatter plots: Relationships between variables

-   **Key Findings & Recommendations**
    -   Which factors matter most for engagement
    -   Actionable recommendations for better content
