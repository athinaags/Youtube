## Introduction & Topic

### Working Title:

What Drives Engagement on YouTube? A Data Analysis of Influencer Metrics and Audience Interaction

### Research Question:

Which factors (e.g., posting time, video length, views, likes, comments) most strongly influence engagement on YouTube?

measurable features like: \* video length \* category \* posting time \* channel size (subscribers) \* etc.

## First Steps

### Run this first

```{r}
install.packages(c("tidyverse","lubridate","skimr","janitor","broom"))
```

### Load packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse) 
library(lubridate)  
library(skimr)      
library(janitor)    
library(broom)       
```

### Import data set

```{r}
yt <- readr::read_csv("data/all_youtube_analytics.csv")
```
### Define Engagement Rate
```{r}
yt_clean <- yt %>%
  mutate(
    engagement_actions = likes + comments + shares,
    engagement_rate = if_else(views > 0, engagement_actions / views, NA_real_)
  )
```
### Video Level Datensatz
```{r}
yt_video <- yt_clean %>%
  group_by(video_id) %>%
  summarise(
    total_views = sum(views),
    total_engagement_actions = sum(engagement_actions),
    engagement_rate = mean(engagement_rate, na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_watch_time = mean(averageViewDuration, na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_view_percentage = mean(averageViewPercentage, na.rm = TRUE),
    total_minutes_watched = sum(estimatedMinutesWatched + estimatedRedMinutesWatched),
    total_likes = sum(likes),
    total_comments = sum(comments),
    total_shares = sum(shares),
    net_subscribers = sum(subscribersGained - subscribersLost)
  )
```
