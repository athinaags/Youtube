# Introduction

## Research question

What factors most strongly influence engagement on YouTube?

### Examples of factors

-   Number of views
-   How long people watch
-   Day of the week posted
-   Number of likes and comments

## Why this matters

Understanding what drives engagement helps us:

-   Make better content
-   Post at the right time
-   Grow our audience faster

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Data Overview

## What data did we analyze?

-   Time period: September 2019 - November 2024 (5 years)
-   Number of videos: About 300 videos
-   Daily records: 234,889 observations
-   Source: YouTube Analytics (official data)

## What we measured

We looked at:

-   Views: How many people watched
-   Likes: Approval
-   Comments: Active engagement
-   Watch time: How long people watched
-   Subscribers gained: New followers

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# What is Engagement?

## Simple definition

Engagement = How much people interact with your videos

$$\text{Engagement Rate} = \frac{\text{Likes + Comments}}{\text{Views}} \times 100$$

## How do we measure if the engagement rate is good or bad?

There is no universal standard for engagement across all youtube channels, so we used our own data

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Our Findings

## First steps

**Status of our data set**: Messy, has gaps, duplicates, mixed-up data types

**Example of what "messy" looks like:**

```         
date          | views | likes | comments | watch_time | notes
2019-09-01    | 1500  | 45    | (blank)  | 12500      | (incomplete)
2019-09-01    | 1500  | 45    | (blank)  | 12500      | (duplicate row!)
2019-09-02    | NULL  | 50    | 3        | (text!)    | (broken data)
```

**What we did:** Clean up this mess into usable files

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
video_perf <- read_csv("../data/video_performance.csv")

summary_stats <- video_perf %>%
  summarise(
    avg_engagement = paste0(round(mean(engagement_rate, na.rm = TRUE), 2), "%"),
    median_engagement = paste0(round(median(engagement_rate, na.rm = TRUE), 2), "%"),
    median_like_rate = paste0(round(median(like_rate, na.rm = TRUE), 2), "%"),
    median_comment_rate = paste0(round(median(comment_rate, na.rm = TRUE), 2), "%")
  )

knitr::kable(summary_stats)
```

## Key statistics

-   Average engagement: 3.32% (meaning on average, 3.32 out of 100 viewers like or comment)
-   Median engagement: 1.89% (middle value - many videos have lower engagement)
-   Likes are more common: About 1.76% average like rate
-   Comments are rare: Only 0.09% average comment rate (comments are 15-20x less common than likes!)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# What Drives Engagement?

## The correlation analysis explained

Correlation = How two things move together

-   +1.0 = Perfect positive relationship (both go up together)
-   0 = No relationship
-   -1.0 = Perfect negative relationship (one goes up, other goes down)

We look for numbers close to +1.0 or -1.0 to find what matters!

## My results - ranked

```{r}
drivers <- data.frame(
  Factor = c("Like Rate", "View Percentage", "Comment Rate", "Watch Duration"),
  Correlation = c("0.99", "0.37", "0.35", "-0.51"),
  Meaning = c(
    "Strongest predictor! Likes show engagement",
    "Videos people watch fully get more engagement",
    "People who comment are engaged",
    "Surprisingly: longer videos have LOWER engagement!"
  )
)

knitr::kable(drivers)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Key Insight 1: Quality Beats Quantity

Videos with fewer views can have HIGHER engagement rates!

-   A video with 1,000 views and 50 likes = 5% engagement (great!)
-   A video with 100,000 views and 500 likes = 0.5% engagement (weak)

Lesson: Focus on making content your audience cares about, not just getting views.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Key Insight 2: Best Days to Post

```{r}
weekly <- read_csv("../data/weekly_pattern.csv")

ggplot(weekly, aes(x = fct_inorder(day_of_week), y = avg_engagement_rate, fill = day_of_week)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(
    title = "Average Engagement by Day of Week",
    x = "Day of Week",
    y = "Engagement Rate (%)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Look at the chart and find the tallest bar - that's your best day to post!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Key Insight 3: Engagement Trends Over Time

```{r}
daily <- read_csv("../data/daily_performance.csv")

ggplot(daily, aes(x = date, y = avg_engagement_rate)) +
  geom_line(color = "#2E86AB") +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", color = "#A23B72", alpha = 0.2) +
  labs(
    title = "Engagement Rate Trend Over Time",
    x = "Date",
    y = "Average Engagement Rate (%)"
  ) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "6 months") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Key Insight 4: Likes vs Comments

```{r}
engagement_types <- data.frame(
  Type = c("Likes", "Comments"),
  Percentage = c(
    round(median(video_perf$like_rate, na.rm = TRUE), 2),
    round(median(video_perf$comment_rate, na.rm = TRUE), 2)
  )
)

ggplot(engagement_types, aes(x = Type, y = Percentage, fill = Type)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Median: Likes vs Comments", y = "Percentage of Viewers (%)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## The takeaway

-   Likes: Easy to give, common (1.76% median)
-   Comments: Harder to give, rare (0.09% median), but show REAL engagement
-   Ratio: About 15-20 likes for every 1 comment

Comments are gold! They show people really care about your content.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# My Recommendations

## 1. Focus on content quality

Not views - engagement!

-   Make videos your audience genuinely cares about
-   A video with 1,000 engaged viewers is better than 100,000 bored viewers
-   Check your best-performing videos and see what they have in common

## 2. Encourage comments

Comments show real engagement

-   Ask questions in your videos
-   Respond to comments (builds community)
-   Comments = free advertising (YouTube shows them to others)

## 3. Post at the right time

Use the day-of-week chart

-   Post when your audience is active
-   Different days work for different audiences
-   Test and monitor what works for YOU

## 4. Watch retention matters

Keep people watching

-   Shorter, focused videos can outperform long ones
-   Hook viewers in the first 10 seconds
-   Get to the point quickly

## 5. Track your progress

Monitor these metrics monthly

-   Engagement rate (likes + comments ÷ views)
-   Like rate
-   Comment rate
-   Subscriber growth

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Summary

## What we learned

1.  Quality \> Quantity: High engagement beats high view counts
2.  Timing matters: Post when your audience is online

## Next steps

1.  Apply these insights to your content strategy
2.  Track your metrics monthly
3.  Test different posting times and content types
